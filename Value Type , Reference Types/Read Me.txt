In this lecture, I'll be discussing the difference between value type and the reference
types.This will teach you how we are dealing everything as "objects".It'll also teach you
how we convert value types to reference types (boxing) to treat value types as an object.
Similarly, a conversion from reference type to value type allows us to use reference types
as a value type or a simple variable.

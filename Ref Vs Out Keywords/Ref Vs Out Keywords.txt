ref --> pass by reference (two way communication or impact)
out --> it is also pass by reference but the value sent by the caller is lost at the start of function execution because it enforces variable to initialize, hence one way communication/impact of the reference. Therefore the value is sent from callie to the caller but caller to callie value is lost and cannot be used inside the function.
